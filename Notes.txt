Objects in JavaScript are dynamic in nature.

Best Practice is to use For...in loop for itetrating 
over the properties of an object.

Best Practice is to use For...of loop for itetrating 
over the elements of an Array.

Every object in JavaScript has a property called constructor.
The constructor refrence the that was used to create or constructorthat object.

JavaScript has built-in constructor functions for
Object(), String(), Boolean(), Number()


Primitives are copied by their value. Objects are copied by their reference.

The for...of loop can only be used with iterables such as arrays and maps.

if('radius' in pie) console.log('yes'); //With the help of in operator you can 
verify if an object contains a specific property.

In low level languages such as C++ you need allocate memory when defineing
an object and deallocate the memory when you are done using that object. In
JacaScript we do not have to worry about this.
Memory allocation and deallocation is automatically done in JavaScript.
When we create an object in JacaScript it automatically allocates memory to 
it and when we are done using that oject the memory is deallocated automatically.
JavaScript Engine has a Garbage Collector its job is to find variables and const
that are no longer being used and deallocate memory from them that was allocated
to them earlier.
