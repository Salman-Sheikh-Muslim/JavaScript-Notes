Why is it best to add <script></script> tag at the end of the body element?

-Reasons:
    The browser parses the file from top to bottom. If you add the script tag of
    your JavaScript in the header your broswer might become busy parasing and 
    executing the JavaScript code and it will not be able to render the content
    of the page. This will create a bad user experience. The user looks at the
    web page and it might be white or blank as your browser is busy executing the 
    JavaScript code.

    Almost always the code that we have needs to talk to the elements on the web page.
    By adding the script tag at the end of the body element we can be sure that the 
    code will work on all the web page elements.

    Exception, Sometimes you need to use third-party code that needs to be used in the 
    head section.
